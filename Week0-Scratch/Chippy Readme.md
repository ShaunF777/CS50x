Chippy is actually our miniature pekingese. Shes about 4 years old now and my daughters love her.
My youngest daughter helped me with an idea of what Chippy had to do and react.
Starting the game, she runs into the view introducing herself, and then giving instructions.
Basically the player uses the arrow keys to move her towards snacks, that she eats.
Eating snack increases your score, so try to beat the high score within the 1 minute game time.
